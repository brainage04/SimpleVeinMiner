# About
This is a very simple Minecraft Fabric mod that adds vein mining to Minecraft.
This mod is required on both the server and client to work.

Hold the Vein Mine Key (set to Grave by default) while mining blocks. Upon breaking a block, up to 64 of its neighbours (horizontal/vertical/diagonal) will be broken alongside it.

This functionality is toggleable through the `enableVeinMining` gamerule.
It is enabled by default.
To disable it, use the `/gamerule` command as you would with any other boolean gamerule.
